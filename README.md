The resources included offer the non-Black community a starting point to educate themselves on the challenges created by systemic racial injustice. Please use these materials, add others that aren't included, and remember to listen to Black friends and colleagues about what it is they need for support. 

The responsibility of educating oneself about racial injustices does not fall on the prejudiced, it falls on the privileged.
